aggregate_event_counts.py: A bunch of API methods for interacting with v4 aggregate event counts in the PuppetDB API.

Operators
See the Operators page for the full list of available operators. Note that inequality operators (<, >, <=, >=) are only supported against the timestamp FIELD.

Fields
FIELD may be any of the following. Unless otherwise noted, all fields support both equality and regular expression match operators, but do not support inequality operators.

certname: the name of the node that the event occurred on.
report: the id of the report that the event occurred in; these ids can be acquired via event queries or via the /reports query endpoint.
status: the status of the event; legal values are success, failure, noop, and skipped.
timestamp: the timestamp (from the puppet agent) at which the event occurred. This field supports the inequality operators. All values should be specified as ISO-8601 compatible date/time strings.
run-start-time: the timestamp (from the puppet agent) at which the puppet run began. This field supports the inequality operators. All values should be specified as ISO-8601 compatible date/time strings.
run-end-time: the timestamp (from the puppet agent) at which the puppet run finished. This field supports the inequality operators. All values should be specified as ISO-8601 compatible date/time strings.
report-receive-time: the timestamp (from the PuppetDB server) at which the puppet report was received. This field supports the inequality operators. All values should be specified as ISO-8601 compatible date/time strings.
resource-type: the type of resource that the event occurred on; e.g., File, Package, etc.
resource-title: the title of the resource that the event occurred on
property: the property/parameter of the resource that the event occurred on; e.g., for a Package resource, this field might have a value of ensure. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
new-value: the new value that Puppet was attempting to set for the specified resource property. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
old-value: the previous value of the resource property, which Puppet was attempting to change. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
message: a description (supplied by the resource provider) of what happened during the event. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
file: the manifest file in which the resource definition is located. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
line: the line (of the containing manifest file) at which the resource definition can be found. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
containing-class: the Puppet class where this resource is declared. NOTE: this field may contain NULL values; see notes below.
latest-report?: whether the event occurred in the most recent Puppet run (per-node). NOTE: the value of this field is always boolean (true or false without quotes), and it is not supported by the regex match operator.

Notes on fields that allow NULL values
In the case of a skipped resource event, some of the fields of an event may not have values. We handle this case in a slightly special way when these fields are used in equality (=) or inequality (!=) queries; specifically, an equality query will always return false for an event with no value for the field, and an inequality query will always return true.

The response is a single JSON map containing aggregated event-count information and a total for how many event-count results were aggregated.

  "successes": 2,
  "failures": 0,
  "noops": 0,
  "skips": 1,

    Returns facts

    :param api_url: Base PuppetDB API url
    :param query: Required. A JSON array of query predicates in prefix form (["<OPERATOR>", "<FIELD>", "<VALUE>"]). This query is forwarded to the events endpoint - see there for additional documentation.
    :param summarize_by: Required. A string specifying which type of object youâ€™d like to see counts for. Supported values are resource, containing-class, and certname.
    :param count_by: Optional. A string specifying what type of object is counted when building up the counts of successes, failures, noops, and skips. Supported values are resource (default) and certname.
    :param counts_filter: Optional. A JSON array of query predicates in the usual prefix form. This query is applied to the final event counts output. Supported operators are =, >, <, >=, and <=. Supported fields are failures, successes, noops, and skips.
    :param distinct_resources: Optional. (EXPERIMENTAL: it is possible that the behavior of this parameter may change in future releases.) This parameter is passed along to the event query - see there for additional documentation.

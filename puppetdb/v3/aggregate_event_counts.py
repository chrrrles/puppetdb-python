    Returns facts

    :param api_url: Base PuppetDB API url
    :param query: Required. A JSON array of query predicates in prefix form (["<OPERATOR>", "<FIELD>", "<VALUE>"]). This query is forwarded to the events endpoint - see there for additional documentation.
    :param summarize_by: Required. A string specifying which type of object youâ€™d like to see counts for. Supported values are resource, containing-class, and certname.
    :param count_by: Optional. A string specifying what type of object is counted when building up the counts of successes, failures, noops, and skips. Supported values are resource (default) and certname.
    :param counts_filter: Optional. A JSON array of query predicates in the usual prefix form. This query is applied to the final event counts output. Supported operators are =, >, <, >=, and <=. Supported fields are failures, successes, noops, and skips.
    :param distinct_resources: Optional. (EXPERIMENTAL: it is possible that the behavior of this parameter may change in future releases.) This parameter is passed along to the event query - see there for additional documentation.
